### AMAZON REVIEW CLASSIFICATION : A Machine Learning Approach

This project applies various machine learning models to the Amazon product review dataset to perform binary classification, multiclass classification, and 
clustering approaches to analyze and categorize product reviews. The objective is to accurately predict product ratings from textual reviews and analyze 
performance using multiple evaluation metrics. Using Scikit-learn, I trained logistic regression, SVM, and perceptron models, tuning hyperparameters via 
cross-validation. Results are benchmarked against baseline F1 scores using confusion matrices, ROC curves, AUC scores, and macro F1 metrics.
