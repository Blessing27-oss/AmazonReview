Binary classification

#### a. Labeling Strategy
Binary labels were created using four cutoffs:
* Cutoff 1: 0 if ≤ 1, 1 otherwise
* Cutoff 2: 0 if ≤ 2, 1 otherwise
* Cutoff 3: 0 if ≤ 3, 1 otherwise
* Cutoff 4: 0 if ≤ 4, 1 otherwise

#### b. Models Used
I tested the following classifiers:
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Perceptron (cost function)

#### c. Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid search with 5-fold cross-validation was used to tune parameters. Each model’s performance was evaluated on a held-out validation set.

#### d. Evaluation Metrics
For each cutoff, we report:
* Confusion Matrix
* Accuracy
* Macro F1 Score
* ROC Curve and AUC
